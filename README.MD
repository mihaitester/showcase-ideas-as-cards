# Readme
I wanted to implement this idea for a while now.
The idea is to create a simple website where people can vote on ideas.
And the ideas are presented in thumbnail form cards. Then if the card corresponding to the idea is clicked a new tab is opened containing the details about the idea.
And there needs to be a simple search bar, and have tags attached to each idea. Even words in the idea title could be considered as tags.

# Features
* search bar
* tags
* cards thumbnails
* detailed view
* infinite scroll
